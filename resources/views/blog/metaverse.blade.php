                        <div class="post-content">

                            <p>Imagine you are working out with your virtual instructor, working on a virtual desk at
                                multiple monitors, and chatting with your friends on a virtual mobile phone screen.
                                Doesn’t it sound impossible? Let me make it possible.</p>
                            <p> <b> Have you ever heard about Metaverse? </b></p>
                            <p>According to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, “In the metaverse, you’ll be able to do almost
                                anything you can imagine — get together with friends and family, work, learn, play,
                                shop, create — as well as completely new experiences that don’t really fit how we think
                                about computers or phones today.”</p>
                            <p> <b> What is Metaverse? </b></p>
                            <p>Today, We live in a world where the internet is two-dimensional. Whereas Metaverse is an
                                immersive virtual world that is facilitated by the use of advanced technologies like
                                virtual reality and augmented reality. simplifying this, Metaverse includes two words.
                                1) Meta: Meta is a Greek letter that stands for “beyond”, and 2) Verse: The term “Verse”
                                is used to define the universe. That means ” beyond of the Universe “.</p>
                            <p>The Metaverse is still in its initial stages. The mainstream is yet to come now. But it
                                has the potential to revolutionize our lives for sure. It will also help people grow
                                their productivity, business, opportunities, Entertainment, education, and
                                health-sector. Metaverse is a collection of technologies. I have mentioned Some of the
                                key technologies below.</p>
                            <p> <b> Key technologies: </b></p>
                            <p>
                                <ol>
                                    <h5><li>  Artificial Intelligence:  </li> </h5>
                                    <ul>
                               <li> There are a bunch of ways to build the metaverse.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                            <p>A) Virtual assistance: AI is useful in powering Virtual assistance in the 3D world of the
                                metaverse. It will make Metaverse more interactive, and easy to navigate.</p>
                            <p>B) To automate tasks: people nowadays want products that are easy to use and include
                               automation and we all know how AI can be useful in automating tasks.</p>
                            <p><a href="https://harshgadhiya.in/what-is-programming/">C</a>) Efficiency: Efficiency and
                                perfectness are something that people crave, and AI is capable enough to take/make
                                decisions. AI can be useful in fraud detection too.</p>
                            <p>2) Virtual reality:<br>=&gt; In the early 1960s, Computer scientist Ivan Sutherland
                                developed the first HMD (head-mounted display). VR headsets allow us to experience
                                virtuality and three-dimensional. For example, we are having a video call on a phone,
                                that is two-dimensional. However, if we are wearing VR glasses, we will be feeling as if
                                that person is just in front of us. So this is Virtual Reality which is Real despite
                                being Virtual. VR headsets display a 360-degree view of the virtual world.</p>
                            <p>3) Augmented reality:<br>=&gt; AR is a bit different from VR. For example, Augmented
                                Reality enhances the user experience in the real world. where VR creates a new world.
                                There are some factors where AR <a href="https://harshgadhiya.in/">technology</a> is
                                used nowadays. Such as healthcare, Education, e-commerce, and gaming.<br>confused? Let’s
                                understand this with an example. A while ago, there was a game called ” Pokémon Go “. It
                                can be considered as the best example. While playing the game, we see a Pokemon in the
                                real world.</p>
                            </ol>
                            <p>summing up, these all technologies including metaverse are in their initial stages of
                                development. With the great future vision of Metaverse, Zuckerberg turned Facebook into
                                a meta. The technologies I have mentioned above are very few. There are much more
                                technologies yet to come, and to be introduced.</p>
